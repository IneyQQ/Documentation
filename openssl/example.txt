openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout server_key.pem -out server_cert.pem -nodes -days 365 -subj "/CN=localhost/O=Client\ Certificate\ Demo"

This is actually a three-step process combined into one command:
Create a new 4096bit RSA key and save it to server_key.pem, without DES encryption (-newkey, -keyout and -nodes)
Create a Certificate Signing Request for a given subject, valid for 365 days (-days, -subj)
Sign the CSR using the server key, and save it to server_cert.pem as an X.509 certificate (-x509, -out)
